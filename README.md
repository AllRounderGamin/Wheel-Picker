[Webpage](https://allroundergamin.github.io/Wheel-Picker/Minified/)

## Challenge
>If you're at a loss for what to do over the summer, a small programming challenge:
using the system of your choice (Windows CLI, OSX, Web, etc), create a wheel-of-fortune,
that accepts parameters which may include words to put on the wheel colours, speed, etc.,
and then animate the wheel.  It must be capable of being repeatedly spun.
No outside source material way be used
(e.g. no images or pre-built stuff, and the entire source code must be under 8K).

### Addendum
>It needs to not stop on the line between entries - i.e. should be easy to confidently declare a result.

## Notes for User
Program automatically announces winner for you, this ensures there are no issues with pixel perfect results.
However, this math to do this will only work to a maximum of 360 items per wheel.
